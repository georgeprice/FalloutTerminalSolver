# Fallout Terminal Solver
Helps you solve the terminal mini-games from Fallout 3, NV and 4.

## The Terminal Minigame
Given a set of words of the same length, you have 4 guesses to try and find the word that matches the terminal's unique password. With each incorrect guess, you are told the number of characters that this word shares with the password.

## Help solving it
This python script helps keep track of what words the password could be (based on the remaining available words), and the best words to choose.

## Using the script
``` python
python solver.py word_a word_b word_c ...
```
